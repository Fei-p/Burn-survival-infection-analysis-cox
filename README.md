# Survival and Infection Control in Burn Patients: A Cox Model Analysis

This project analyzes survival in burn patients and explores infection-related risk using **Cox proportional hazards** modeling. It includes data cleaning, exploratory survival analysis (KM curves, log-rank tests), model building/diagnostics, and interpretation of hazard ratios.

## ðŸ“¦ Dataset

We use the **`burn`** dataset from the **KMsurv** package (Klein & Moeschberger survival datasets).  
It contains **time-to-event** outcomes with **event indicators** and clinical covariates relevant to burn severity and infection control.

- **Source:** `KMsurv::burn`  
- **Outcome:** survival time (e.g., hospital time or follow-up) and event (death) indicator  
- **Covariates (examples):** demographic and burn-severity measures (e.g., extent of burn), and infection-related variables documented in the package reference.

> Load in R:
> ```r
> install.packages("KMsurv")
> library(KMsurv)
> data("burn")
> str(burn)
> ```

> **Note:** Please consult `?KMsurv::burn` for precise variable definitions.
